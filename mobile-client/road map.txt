 as an Author I create a set of courses to achieve a goal 
 
 as a Member of community I offer an alternative data source of a course 
 
 as a Member of community I increase the rate of the data source 
 
 Implementation: 
  - author course source and alternative source are presented on the same page, distinguished by label ('author', 'alternative'), sorted by rate 
  - course source has comments sorted by rate as well, the aim of the comment is to provide additional information  (Does app really need it?)
  - mechanics of feedback [a] to community [b] to author [c] to deveoper or open source community (promised and achieved, new ideas, how did it help community member, broken sources)
